# Deisgn Patterns in Java

## Depedency Injection

When using other classes in your class, pass in already instantiated objects into your classes constructor 
(in stead of instantiating them in your class).

Why: Separation of responsibilities
* creating classes is non trivial
* leads to a more loosely couple system that becomes easier to change
* more testable because depedencies can be swapped out for test objects during runtime.

DI is a type of Inversion of Control

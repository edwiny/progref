Reading All Bytes or Lines from a File
If you have a small-ish file and you would like to read its entire contents in one pass, you can use the readAllBytes(Path) or readAllLines(Path, Charset) method. These methods take care of most of the work for you, such as opening and closing the stream, but are not intended for handling large files. The following code shows how to use the readAllBytes method:

Path file = ...;
byte[] fileArray;
fileArray = Files.readAllBytes(file);
Writing All Bytes or Lines to a File
You can use one of the write methods to write bytes, or lines, to a file.

write(Path, byte[], OpenOption...)
write(Path, Iterable< extends CharSequence>, Charset, OpenOption...)
The following code snippet shows how to use a write method.

Path file = ...;
byte[] buf = ...;
Files.write(file, buf);

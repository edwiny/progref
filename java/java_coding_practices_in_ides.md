# Notes about using IDEs to code Java

- when using interfaces, create the Impl class first then use IDE to create interface from there. Then use ide to ovoerride the abstract methods.


- start with the data model, then the persistence layer, then the service.

- Set "Force braces" for if / for / while statements (in IDEA under Editor -> Coding Style -> Java)
- In same vein change imports to always do single class imports, and make limit of imports from the same class to be converted to a * import to 999.

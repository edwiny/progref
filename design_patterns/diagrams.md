When drawing diagrams of classes, use the following convention (simpplified UML)

* Inheritance / "extends" : solid line with solid triangle head. The head points to the class being inherited from.
* Interface / "implements": dotted line with solid triangle head
* Composition / "has a" : solid line with solid arrow head.

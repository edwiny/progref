# Design Principals 

## Single Responsibility

## Open-closed

## Loose Coupling

## Favour Composition over Inheritance

Composition establishes a HAS-A relationship between classes.


## Program to an interface, not an implemenmtation

## Encapsulates what varies

Identify aspects of your application that vary and separate them from 
what stays the same.

Drives the following patterns:

* Strategy
* Iterator
* Factory

## Traditional OO - Encapsulation

## Traditional OO - Abstraction

## Traditional OO - Polymorphism

Dynamic binding - lets you substitute objects with the same interface for each other at runtime.
## Traditional OO - Inheritance

Inheritance expresses a IS-A relationship between classes.

WARNING: Overusing inheritance leads to designs that are inflexiable and difficult to change.

if all your class relationships are IS-A relationships, take a closer look at your design.

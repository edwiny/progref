# Software Engineering General Guidance


## Avoiding bugs

### Understand the requirements

As a programmer, you need to understand the requirements of a program that you are going to work on. If you have doubts, you can always find some help on the Internet or among fellow developers.

### Decomposition

Decompose a program into small units that are easy to look through and understand. A good architecture reduces software complexity, and, as a consequence, the number of errors.


### Easy to read

Write easy-to-read-code and follow all the standards of the language. It will also allow you to make fewer errors.

### Automated Testing

Run the program with boundary input values. Do not forget to consider different cases: 0 or a huge number as an input value, 0 or 1 element as an input sequence. Such cases often reveal bugs.
Write automated tests that will check the program at the build time.
